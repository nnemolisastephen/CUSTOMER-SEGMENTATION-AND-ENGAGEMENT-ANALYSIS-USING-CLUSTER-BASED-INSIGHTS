## CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS USING CLUSTER-BASED INSIGHTS
1. Project Overview

1.1. Introduction

Customer segmentation is a powerful tool for businesses to identify and understand distinct groups within their customer base. By dividing customers into segments based on shared characteristics, companies can tailor marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve customer retention.
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using data from the 365 program’s customer base. The segmentation will be done using clustering techniques, and the resulting segments will be analyzed to provide actionable insights.

1.2. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and the channel through which the customers learn. The ultimate goal is to help identify high-value customers based on CLV and engagement levels and develop targeted marketing strategies.

1.3. Dataset

The dataset contains 4 columns with 3834 rows. The names of the features are:
•	minutes watched: The number of minutes a student has watched since joining the program
•	CLV (Customer Lifetime Value): shows the total amount of revenue generated by that customer
•	Region:  This is the geographical region where the student comes from. USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia (0) Western Europe (1) Rest of the World (2)
•	Channel:  This is the channel through which the customer has learned about the 365 program (1 Google 2 Facebook 3 YouTube 4 LinkedIn 5 Twitter 6 Instagram 7 Friend 8 Other)

2. Data Preprocessing

2.1. Data Cleaning

- Missing Values: I checked for missing values in the dataset. Missing values were found in minutes watched column. These were handled by filling it in with 0. This is because the missing values may represent customers who registered but did not watch any minute.
- Outliers: Outliers were dropped.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.1. Univariate Analysis

- CLV Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of CLV to understand the revenue generated by each customer.
- Minutes watched: Examined the distribution of minutes watched to identify the engagement level of the registered customers
- Channel: Explored which channels were popular among customers that helped them in deciding to sign up for the program.

3.2. Bivariate Analysis

- Minutes watched vs. CLV: Plotted a scatter plot of minutes watched against CLV to identify patterns in the data.

- Insights

There is no clear linear relationship between minutes_watched and CLV. While one might expect that customers who watch more content have a higher CLV, this plot suggests that the relationship is not straightforward. There are customers with high CLVs despite having watched a relatively low number of minutes, and vice versa. This indicates that other factors beyond just minutes watched are influencing CLV

.4. Modeling

4.1. Clustering Algorithm Selection

- K-Means Clustering: Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling large datasets. It's particularly well-suited for customer segmentation tasks where we expect distinct, well-separated clusters.

- Hierarchical Clustering: Chosen to give us an idea of the optimal k to choose.
- Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). The sum of squared distances (inertia) was plotted against different values of k, and the elbow point was identified at k=6.
- Silhouette Score: Calculated to validate the quality of clusters, with a score of 0.50 indicating moderately well-defined clusters.

4.2. Clustering Results and Interpretation

Cluster Descriptions:

- Cluster 0 & 1: Low Engagement, Low Value - Potential churn-risk or new users.
- Cluster 2: High Engagement, High Value - Loyal, high-value customers.
- Cluster 3: Moderate Engagement, Moderate Value - Steady, mid-tier customers.
- Cluster 4: Niche Engagement, Low to Moderate Value - Specialized segment with specific habits.
- Cluster 5: Low Engagement, High Variability in Value - Occasional high-value spenders.

4.3. Visualization

- Cluster Scatter Plot: Visualized the clusters using a 2D scatter plot (minutes watched vs. CLV) with different colors representing each cluster.
- Bar plot: A bar plot was used to visualize channels by region.

5. Evaluation

5.1. Cluster Validation

- Silhouette Analysis: Performed silhouette analysis to assess the consistency within clusters. The average silhouette score provided insight into how well-separated the clusters are.

5.2. Interpretation and recommendations

The segmentation successfully identified six distinct customer segments. 

Cluster 0- Low Engagement, Low Value:
- This cluster represents customers who have minimal interaction with the platform. They watch very few minutes of content and contribute little to the overall revenue (low CLV). These customers are at risk of churn or may simply be casual users. We can launch campaigns aimed at increasing engagement, such as offering personalized content recommendations or incentives for watching more content.

Cluster 1 - Low Engagement, Low Value:

- Similar to Cluster 0, this cluster consists of customers who do not engage much with the platform and contribute minimally to the revenue. Focusing on personalized content recommendations to better match the interests of these users may potentially increase their engagement. Discounts, and free trials are some promotions that can encourage these users to re-engage with the platform.

Cluster 2 - High Engagement, High Value:
- These are the platform’s most engaged and valuable customers. They spend a significant amount of time watching content and have a high CLV, making them key to the business’s success. Focusing on retaining these customers and possibly encouraging them to engage even more could increase their already high CLV.  For example, introducing premium content or exclusive access options to further increase their value and engagement. We can also regularly collect feedback from this group to ensure that the platform continues to meet their needs and preferences.

 Cluster 3 - Moderate Engagement, Moderate Value:

- This cluster consists of customers who have a moderate level of engagement and provide a steady revenue stream. They are neither the most engaged nor the least. We might run targeted campaigns to increase their engagement, such as content tailored to their viewing history or interest-based recommendations.

Cluster 4 - Niche Engagement, Low to Moderate Value:
- Customers in this cluster have specific viewing habits and contribute a moderate amount of revenue. They may be interested in niche content or have particular usage patterns. Create communities or forums around niche content areas to increase their engagement and sense of belonging. Watch for changes in their behavior that could signal an opportunity to grow this segment’s value.

Cluster 5- Low Engagement, High Variability in Value:
- Despite lower engagement, some customers in this cluster have a high CLV, indicating they might be making high-value purchases without consuming a lot of content. Focus on understanding and replicating the factors that drive high value in this cluster, such as premium offerings, upsells, or specific content that appeals to high spenders.

6.  Further analysis
     
- Understanding the clusters based on their preference for each channel in relation to the region. This can help tailor marketing efforts to better align with the preferences and behaviors of different regions, optimizing resource allocation and maximizing impact. Some of the interpretations and recommendations for some clusters are explained below:

6.1 Cluster 3

- Channel 3 is the most dominant channel across all regions. It consistently shows the highest usage, particularly in Region 1, where its usage surpasses other regions. This suggests that Channel 3 is crucial in this region. Channel 2 and Channel 1 also have significant usage, but their dominance is more region-specific. Channel 2 is particularly dominant in Region 0, while Channel 1 is relatively evenly distributed between Region 0 and Region 2, with Region 1 having slightly lower engagement

    Recommendation

- Channel 3 is the most widespread channel across all regions, indicating its general appeal. Therefore, Channel 3 should be the primary focus for marketing efforts, especially in Region 1. Campaigns tailored to this channel are likely to reach a broad audience and yield high engagement. In Region 0, Channel 2 should be targeted alongside Channel 3, as it shows significant dominance in that region. Channels 4, 6, 7, and 8 present an opportunity for growth. These channels could be targeted for special promotions, incentives, or exclusive content to increase their usage.



6.2 Cluster 4

- Region 2 clearly shows a dominant presence across Channels 5, 6, 7, and 8. Channel 7 is particularly noteworthy, with the highest count, indicating that it might be a major channel for customer engagement in this region. Region 1 shows consistently low usage across all channels, suggesting that these channels might not be as effective in reaching customers in this region.

    Recommendations

- Given the dominance of Channel 7 in Region 2, marketing strategies should prioritize this channel. Campaigns leveraging this channel are likely to reach a large audience in Region 2.  For Region 1, it may be beneficial to reassess the effectiveness of Channels 5 through 8. Since engagement is low, these channels might not be the best focus for marketing in this region, or alternative channels should be explored

6.3 Cluster 5
- Channels 6, 7, and 8 are overwhelmingly dominated by Region 0, with Region 0 having significantly higher counts in these channels compared to Region 1. Channel 5 has very low usage across both regions, with a slight presence in Region 0 and almost negligible usage in Region 1.

    Recommendations

- We will have to focus marketing efforts heavily on Channels 6, 7, and 8 if we are targeting Region 0. These channels are crucial for reaching the majority of the audience in this region. Consider allocating more resources (such as budget and content) to Channel 8, given its dominant position in Region 0. Since Channel 5 has very low usage in both regions, you might want to deprioritize this channel in your marketing strategy, especially if resources are limited. However, if there is a specific niche audience using this channel, targeted and highly specialized marketing might still be effective.


6.4 Cluster 6

- Region 2 is the most engaged across multiple channels, especially Channels 3, 4, 2, and 8. This indicates that customers in Region 2 are interacting with a wider range of channels, suggesting diverse preferences or higher engagement levels. Region 0 shows significant usage in Channel 1, but overall, it has a more limited engagement across other channels. Region 1 shows lower usage across all channels except for Channel 2, where it has moderate engagement.

    Recommendations

- Marketing strategies should prioritize Channel 3 and Channel 4 in Region 2, where these channels show the highest usage. Given the broad engagement, Region 2 could be targeted with multi-channel campaigns. Channel 2 could be a focal point in Region 1, given its relative strength in this region. However, the overall lower engagement across other channels suggests that more research is needed to understand the preferences in this region

7. Conclusion

The customer segmentation project successfully identified eight distinct customer segments based on CLV and minutes watched. Further analysis showed us the preference and each cluster for a channel and how it impacts the region. These insights can be leveraged to enhance marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve customer retention. The project demonstrates the value of data-driven decision-making in understanding and catering to the diverse needs of a customer base.
